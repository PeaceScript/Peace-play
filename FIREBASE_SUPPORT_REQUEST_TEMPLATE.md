Subject: Release reserved Hosting Site ID `peace-play-official` for project `peace-play-official`

Hello Firebase Support Team,

We migrated our app (Peace Play) from old Firebase project `peace-script-ai` to new project `peace-play-official`.

Current status:
- Old project: `peace-script-ai`
- New project: `peace-play-official`
- Desired Hosting Site ID: `peace-play-official`
- Temporary live site in new project: `peace-play-official-d6c9e`

We already deleted `peace-play-official` from old project successfully, but when creating it in new project we receive:

`HTTP 400: Invalid name: peace-play-official is reserved by another project; try something like peace-play-official-xxxxx instead`

Request:
Please release/unreserve the Hosting Site ID `peace-play-official` so we can create it under project `peace-play-official`.

Business impact:
We need to restore our original production URL `https://peace-play-official.web.app` after migration.

Thank you.
